# Poker Statistics

This program lets you keep track of your poker results and perform statistical analysis on it.

## Goals

I like poker and I like statistics. Even though I'm not playing to earn money, I can't deny the thrill of getting far ahead in a tournament. In order to maximise the chance of that I want to create a tool that tells me in which types of tournaments I perform better and which types of tournaments I should avoid.

The goal of this project is to create that tool for me, and for other people who might be interested.
